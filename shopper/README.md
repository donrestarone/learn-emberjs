# lessons learned
## routing
if you want an index page, you can generate an application index page by running
* `ember g route index`
this will create an index.hbs at the application level

## route helpers
route helpers can be defined with the following syntax:
* `<LinkTo @route="item" @model="2">Product 2</LinkTo>`
`LinkTo` will generate an anchor tag and the @route declaration will point to the item route which requires an ID which is provided as @model

## generating components
the component class and component template need to be generated separately
* `ember g component product` => generates product.hbs
* `ember g component-class product` => generates product.js
